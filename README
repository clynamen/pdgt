*** Description

PDGT it's just a bar (I place it under dwm's bar), click on it with 
the right mouse button and you will get the translation of the current 
mouse selection. 
I still need to check the regex, but it seems to work fine.

*** Usage

Remember, use python 3

Usage: main.py [options] arg1

 Right click on bar to retrive translation of the mouse selection
